            Thankfully for me, software engineering couldn't be a wiser career
            choice. After over 10 years in the healthcare field, I made the
            decision in 2018 to change my career path to become a software
            engineer and haven't looked back! Switching to software engineering
            was a no-brainer for me. I previously did art and photography as
            A-level subjects at a performing arts sixth-form college and went on
            to do a foundation year in art and photography, before pursuing
            healthcare. Software engineering, for me, has re-ignited my
            creativity. It also challenges me mentally on a daily basis which is
            all could ask for from a life-long career.
          </p>

            In my free time I enjoy being social. I also enjoy travelling solo,
            as I am very much a people person and enjoy the undivided
            opportunity of meeting new people from all walks of life and
            culture. I also use this as an opportunity to try and enhance my
            photography skills and try out different outdoor activities.

            In early March 2020, I completed the Software Engineering Immersive
            curriculum at Flatiron School London, whose curriculum largely
            revolved around React.js/JavaScript frontend, Ruby/Rails backend
            and versions of SQL, as well as RESTful API concepts, utilising full
            CRUD actions and use of hooks and Redux. Since, I have continued to
            enhance my skill set and began some contract work as a web developer
            with Engaging Tech, whoâ€™s stack involves React.js, node.js, mongoDB,
            Redux-sagas, Apollo graphQL.
