            Thankfully for me, software engineering couldn't be a wiser career
            choice. After over 10 years in the healthcare field, I made the
            decision in 2018 to change my career path to become a software
            engineer and haven't looked back! Switching to software engineering
            was a no-brainer for me. I previously did art and photography as
            A-level subjects at a performing arts sixth-form college and went on
            to do a foundation year in art and photography, before pursuing
            healthcare. Software engineering, for me, has re-ignited my
            creativity. It also challenges me mentally on a daily basis which is
            all could ask for from a life-long career.
          </p>

            In my free time I enjoy being social. I also enjoy travelling solo,
            as I am very much a people person and enjoy the undivided
            opportunity of meeting new people from all walks of life and
            culture. I also use this as an opportunity to try and enhance my
            photography skills and try out different outdoor activities.

            Having intensely learnt and completed the Software Engineering
            Immersive curriculum at Flatiron School London, I am proficient as a
            full stack software engineer with main frameworks of Rails and
            React, languages Ruby and JavaScript (and other skills, below), and
            constantly adding to my skills and portfolio. I am actively seeking
            a junior software engineering role (full stack/ front end/ backend)
            and am excited to gain experience in the field. I have just started
            an Advanced CSS course to enhance my proficiency in CSS/SaSS. My
            next intentions are to learn Python and Node.js, as well as any
            required learning to help me excel in my career.
